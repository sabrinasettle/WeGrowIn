# WeGrowIn
A Small Project for the Tandem Application

The project is a Ruby app, using a ERB partial as the front end.

## Install Ruby if needed
To install Ruby, I used Homebrew and I recommend that if you do not already have it.

## Running the project
Head into the WaterMeTandem directory and from there the project can be run with ./launcher.rb, and if not that may mean its permissions have change so the command will change that.
```bash
chmod u+x launcher.rb
```
On running ./launcher.rb, a server will run at localhost:8000, so head there to see the results!

Please use Ctrl C to close the server when done or else it will keep running on that port!

## On the Front End 

The front end interacts with the ruby back end by using a index.erb.html and then copying that info over to a index.html
